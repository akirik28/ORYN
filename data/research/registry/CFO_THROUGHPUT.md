# ORYN Research Freeze — CFO Throughput Checkpoint

**Maintained by: CFO (S10, capacity/throughput/bottleneck control).** Rewritten in place at
each checkpoint, not appended to — prior checkpoints live in this file's own git history
(`git log -p -- data/research/registry/CFO_THROUGHPUT.md` on `oryn/research-freeze-cfo-
throughput`). I do not research opportunity facts, source photos, alter records, or override
evidence — this file tracks fleet capacity and flags backlogs/misallocations only.
Cross-reference: `GAP_MAP.md` (CEO's coverage/content state) and `SESSION_CLOSEOUT_2026-08-
26_to_27.md` (CEO's consolidated fleet report). On a 5-minute recurring check (`/loop`, per
founder instruction) — fleet is under dynamic reassignment (P0-P7), not stopping; watching
for dead sessions per founder's explicit ask at checkpoint 139.

## Checkpoint 151 — 2026-08-27, ~11:35

**No dead servers.** Same 9 peers, relaunched sessions ~1h old, originals 12h.

**S5A appears to have finished its gap-closure work.** `oryn/s5a-summer-academic-enrichment`
advanced +15 → +16, 2 minutes ago: "S5A batch10: gap-closure for final 11 verified_current
summer_program rows" — labeled "final," following batches 7-9 (checkpoints 142, 147, 149).
Across those four batches: 14 + 9 + 9 + 11 = 43 rows closed. Watching next tick for whether
S5A picks up a new P0-P7 assignment or goes idle/reassigned.

All other branches unchanged since checkpoint 150. Live-harm-surface rows re-verified: still
all correct.

### Open items (unchanged)

1. `turkey_student_access` / `selectivity_evidence` — research complete, DB columns still
   don't exist.
2. University-photo false-accept rate — S2's ~16% vs. my earlier ~12-15%, not yet reconciled.
3. Browser-pane contention risk — only S4's exposure remains unconfirmed; CEO handling
   directly.
